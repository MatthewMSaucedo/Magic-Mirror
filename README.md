## Vision Statement

The mirror is used to display useful information such as weather, travel times, calendar events, and more. 
For a student this can be the difference between knowing when an assignment is due and missing it entirely.
For a young professional it can ensure before leaving for work that there are no accidents are on the way and keep them informed of the current events. 

The magic mirror can be programmed to display different types of information depending on the userâ€™s needs and lifestyle.
The flexibility of this mirror sets it apart from other types of devices because may people have mirrors in their room which they check before they go out. Displaying various types of information on this mirror is a major convenience, for you can multitask even better.

**Backlogs**: We've chosen to implement a Kanban board using Github Projects. Within this tab lies our [Product and Sprint Backlogs]() as well as the current status for tasks we're tackling within the current sprint. As these tasks are finished, they are moved to done, which is essentially the "done" pile of the Sprint Backlog. Github labels are used for priority and categorizing.

**Burndown Chart**: Our burndown chart is automated based on each Sprint milestone and populated as issues are moved to "done" and closed. [Click here](http://radekstepan.com/burnchart/#!/jrmusan/Magic-Mirror) to see this live.

**User Stories**: User stories and related tasks are implemented as Github issues and, as mentioned, are tagged according to priority/category. Validation criteria can be seen within the respective issue as well
